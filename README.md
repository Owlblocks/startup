Baobab (baobab-gifs.click)

Baobab is a website for hosting GIFs. It's similar to Giphy, but with a focus on sharing GIFs with friends rather than uploading them for strangers.
Features:
- Upload GIFs to the website
- Add friends
- View your own GIFs and your friends'
- Pin certain friends' pages to your hotbar
- Favorite GIFs to your favorites page

Notes:
Simon HTML:
- A lot of what I learned concerned the basics of how svg images work. By the time I typed out the code, I understood, basically, what the vectors meant

Simon CSS:
- With the Bootstrap framework, so much of what I had to change was in the HTML. A lot more than I'd anticipated.

Simon Javascript:
- localStorage is per-browser; switching from firefox to chrome reset the scores
- sound usage is fairly simple in javascript
- you can link js objects to elements through a dictionary structure
